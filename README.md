If working from existing theme - download shopify files

```
yarn run download
```


If working from new theme - zip files then upload to shopify

yarn run zip
```

## ENV Scripts

To toggle your environment change the line of code at top of config.yml, then run the corresponding commands.

```bash
$ cd /src/widgets/vue
$ yarn run start:dev
```

```
mode: development
```

```
yarn start:dev
yarn watch:dev
```

```
mode: production
```

```
yarn start:prod
yarn watch:prod
```

If your Shopify theme is up to date with you local project, run the watch command instead of start.

```
yarn watch:dev
```

## Notes

The repository can be used with a regular Themekit approach - adding styles/scripts directly to the base shopify folders (assets for example)But this approach defeats a lot of the repo's purpose. For details on how to use the advanced features check out the guides directory.

The webpack file contains a number of useful aliases for easier imports.  For example the styles, scripts folders can be imported with these aliases `@styles` `@scripts`.

```

## Gotchas

The browserUpdate.js file is used to trigger BrowserSync reloads. It should not be edited.
